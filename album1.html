                    <p>Goblin is Tyler, The Creator’s major label debut and second album overall, released in May 10, 2011. 
                        The album features the rapper’s most controversial lines that involve homophobia and misogyny, such as 
                        in the song “Tron Cat,” in which Tyler raps: Victim, victim, honey, you’re my fifth one Honey on that

                        well as the album featuring Tyler’s breakout single, “Yonkers.” The California native continues the story 
                        between him and his therapist, Dr. TC, as he appeared on his first solo project, Bastard. As the sessions 
                        progress, Tyler loses touch of reality and kills all of his friends, just to realize that all of the 
                        characters, including Dr. TC are all just a part of his imagination. This is the second project to have 
                        the last track complete the title for the project, as it can also be seen in Bastard, as the final track
