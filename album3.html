                    <p>Cherry Bomb, Tyler’s fourth studio album released on April 13, 2015, is Tyler’s personal favorite off of his discography. The entire album was produced by Tyler himself, with some additionational production by Mike Einziger on two tracks. Cherry Bomb is easily Tyler’s happiest and most positive album. Preceded by the dual singles “FUCKING YOUNG” and “DEATHCAMP,” which sound ominous but are actually quite upbeat, the record found favor with critics, but less so with fans. There were still some lyrically dark moments. During “PILOT” Tyler allows his bad guy persona to manifest itself into physical harm, but tracks like “RUN” exemplified his newfound positivity, as he chastises his competition for wasting their young lives with substances and materialism. Some criticism focused on the mixing of the record. “2SEATER,” “BUFFALO,” “PILOT,” and “OKAGA, CA” all sound like they were ripped off a particularly worn vinyl record. This is contrasted by the technicolor of “SMUCKERS,” which provides incredibly crisp and fresh vocal mixing, especially on Kanye’s verse. Tyler was quick to respond to criticism surrounding the theme of the record: Why cant i share my joy with the world? ohhh, it was cool when i was raping girls and telling you how sad i was on records, but when shit changes and im feeling great and i fuck with myself you cant deal with it? cause you cant relate? is that why? or maybe its my ego talking. idk know what it is, but after a while you realize you dont want to be around people who isnt positive, who isnt focused who dont want more. why would you want to be around someone is is a downer? and i dont even mean depressed, i mean niggas who is always just fucking everyones mood up? everytime they talk its something negative? am i wrong cause i dont want that in my life? its crazy, all im doing is spreading good vibes and tryna give some confidence to people and at least telling them they can accoplish something. sometimes giving some people some hope can really push people to be great.<p>
